        <h1>CYCLING</h1>
        <h2>My favourite of all Times</h2>
        <p>

            Cycling is mainly an aerobic activity, which means that your heart, blood vessels and lungs all get a
            workout. You will
            breathe deeper, perspire and experience increased body temperature, which will improve your overall fitness
            level. The
            health benefits of regular cycling include: increased cardiovascular fitness.
            If you're looking to shed some pounds or maintain a healthy weight, cycling for 30 minutes can be your ally.
            It burns
            calories, making it an effective tool for weight management. Plus, it enhances your metabolism, helping you
            burn
            calories after finishing your ride.
            iI love cycling beacause each trail will take you off the beaten track to discover old and new architecture,
            urban forests, beaches, polders,
            parks and waterways. The idea is to take your time and enjoy the scenery. Just see what you feel like
            seeing.

        <p>Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower
            body,
            including your legs, hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that's gentle on your back, hips, knees, and
            ankles, this
            is a great choice</p>
